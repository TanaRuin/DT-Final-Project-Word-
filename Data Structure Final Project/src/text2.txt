Extensive Reading and Its Mysteries      Learning language does not come naturally to everyone. It is a intensive process of practicing, studying, reviewing mistakes, reading and learning from others until you have understood the inner workings of a certain language. There are myriads of way on how one can approach the task of language learning, one of those being extensive reading. Extensive reading has been a proven and effective way of comprehending a language. The following essay will explore the topic of extensive reading, it�s benefits and the drawback it has.	The term extensive reading was first mentioned by Harold Palmer back in 1917 (Kelly, 1969).  According to Grabe (2012), extensive reading itself meant the process of reading longer, easier texts for an extended period without a breakdown of comprehension, feeling overwhelmed, or the need to take breaks. Essentially, the concept behind extensive reading is a reading technique used for lengthy and simple texts without breaks while maintaining perception of the materials. According to Waring and Mclean (2015), there is two ways how extensive reading should be defined. �Purist ER� in which students will read a large amount without assessment and �Integrated ER�, which refers to students reading a large amount with assignments to practice their 4 skills (fluency, inferencing, monitoring and evaluation).	On the other hand, extensive reading counterpart, intensive reading is reading shorter, harder to read texts to procure specific information. It�s known to develop ability to think critically and improve analytical skills and provide benefit towards grammar and vocabulary understanding. While both reading provides excellent benefits, extensive reading has become the more widely used and viable method to assist in language learning compared to intensive reading because of its added enjoyability and autonomy.	One of the advantages of ER mentioned is learner�s autonomy. Extensive reading is done in a way where student can decide what themselves want to study and learn, which in turn, greatly increases the enjoyability and motivation to continue reading. By reading a lot more, it also helps in developing a wide range of vocabulary and understanding specific grammatical structures.	Extensive reading has also been proven to improve reading fluency. According to research conducted by Hidayat on the �Effectiveness of Extensive Reading� (2018), It was discovered that students scores improved after using extensive reading compared to before. The approach of ER significantly affected their reading comprehension.	Extensive reading has also been linked with improvement in writing skills. Through extensive reading, students are more likely to acquire new skills and knowledge which in turn produce better writing skill and improvement to overall literacy. Extensive reading is also linked to benefit to overall language competency. For example, Cho and Krashen (1994), found out four ESL learners increased skills in listening and speaking just through extensive reading.      Extensive reading provides a lot of advantages but is without its setback. One of the drawbacks of extensive reading is limited effect on improving innate critical thinking and analytical abilities. The easy-to-read texts through extensive reading does not provide any benefit towards improving the way someone can analyze complex and structured information in a short amount of time.             Another negative of ER is the amount of time needed. Because of the long texts that students need to read, it takes up a significant amount of time which can be used towards other method and tools of studying. If time could be compensated, the next hurdle would be the lack of relevant reading materials for students to go through. Without an available source or material executing ER can be a massive setback for any students.            The next point of disadvantage is ER can be tiresome and distracting. ER is based on the huge amount of text in which can be tiresome to go through and by reading a lot of topics at once, it limits the ability to focus and pinpoint on one topic that students are interested in, which could make ER not as much efficient as it can be.            There are also some limitations towards extensive reading which makes it less effective compared to intensive reading where most of the learners need to be able to read independently without guidance, beginner level learners will find it hard to enter ER, and students who does not enjoy reading as primary way of studying a language.             In conclusion, extensive reading is a method of reading long texts for a extended period while maintaining comprehension. The counterpart of extensive reading is intensive reading which focuses on short but intuitive and complex text which consist of specific information about a certain topic. There are two primary types of extensive reading, purist and integrated. Extensive reading also brings a lot of benefit such as learners� autonomy, increased language fluency, improved writing skills. However, ER also has a few drawbacks which are limited effect on analytical and critical thinking, time consuming, tiresome, and distracting. To sum up, extensive reading is still a great method of learning albeit the drawback it possesses.                                                                                          ?
